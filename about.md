Hello! I'm Wilde Chu, an undergraduate senior at RPI, majoring in Computer Science and Math.

I'm studying to be a software engineer with a strong interest in Computer Graphics. I also enjoy pure mathematics, currently Abstract Algebra and Topology.

In my spare time you can find me cooking, gaming, learning random trivia through osmosis, or working on one of my numerous unfinished CS projects.
