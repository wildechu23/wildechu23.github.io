This website displays a map of restrooms known in the database, giving users a name, location, rating and reviews. Users can contribute to it by adding locations or editing existing ones.

The frontend uses React and Vite, with Leaflet with OSM as the map library.
The app communicates with a server using Node and Express, which interacts with an SQL database that stores information in 3 tables, Location, Restrooms, and Reviews.

You can find the React App [here](https://github.com/wildechu23/Toilet) and the server [here](https://github.com/wildechu23/Toilet-Server).
